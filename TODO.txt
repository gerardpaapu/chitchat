Make Chitchat as self-hosting as possible
---

- Is this desirable? It won't really make it more portable, because it necessarily runs on a JS runtime
- It is cool, and it might make the compiler less LOC
- The Tokenizer/Parser/Compiler/ can be translated (need test coverage first)
- Much of the runtime can be chitchat

There's Basically no documentation
-----

- write some

The Parse doesn't retain location information
--

- Wrap each parse value in a Syntax object (src/compiler/syntax.js)
- Get the compiler to emit a source-map file https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap

The whole compiler is mess
--

- Get rid of the 'function compile (stx) { return compiler.compile(stx); }' everywhere
- Make sure that I'm using Symbol::toJSSymbol() everywhere I should be 
- src/compiler/primitives/accessor.js is incomplete
- Needs to be more... typesafe, whatever that means in this context

Emitting strings from the ChitChat AST has got to stop
--

- Intermediary language? (with direct mapping to JS)
- Emit Uglify objects?

Should start running the code
--

- Write a script to browserify a bunch of compiled chitchat source
- Write a method to eval chitchat directly 

Tests
--

- Need some
